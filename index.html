        <p>When designing any product with at least one user in mind, it is important to not
        jump the gun and dive head-first into the actual designing phase. Any form of design
        requires brainstorming, prototyping, and testing, all of which need to be iterated upon
        multiple times to end up with a satisfying final product. This is especially the case
        for human-centered design, which focuses on meeting the needs and goals of the user
        in mind. Without these carefully-planned stages of development, the end product will
        not meet the needs of the consumer.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Over the entirety of this course, I have learned many extremely valuable lessons from
        following the general steps of the widely-accepted "design process," which includes
        brainstorming and ideation, sketching, prototyping, testing, and final adjustments. Some
        of these major key points gathered from adhering to the design process include:</p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>User testing is an absolute necessity</li>
            <li>Learn the limitations of the technology</li>
            <li>Maintain an understanding of scope in a limited time frame</li>
            <li>Designing applications is more than just good code</li>
            <li>If you're not satisfied, no one will be</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>All of these valuable pieces of information will help any person attempting the design
        process to truly appreciate what results it offers.</p>
